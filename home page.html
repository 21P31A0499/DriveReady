      DNA, as one of the most promising research objects for molecular computing, is often used to construct the basic modules of computing. A simple and multiplexable DNA logic computing platform comprising a basic two input logic gate AND and OR, is designed by using G-quadruplex combined with NMM to generate fluorescence mechanism as output signal and DNA strand as input signal. Designed DNA strand displacement and catalytic hairpin self-assembly, achieving enzyme-free and label-free, simplified the design and reduced the cost. Strand displacement reactions not only enable signal amplification, but also provide methods to implement multi-layer cascading and solve complex computational problems by utilizing the basic logic gate AND and OR. In summary, this logic platform can realize the design of complex logic circuit by the constructed simple underlying logic gate AND and OR, which provides the potential to solve complex computational problems.
